[![MELPA](https://melpa.org/packages/remind-bindings-badge.svg)](https://melpa.org/#/remind-bindings)

 It is sometimes hard to remember what bindings you have set without having to open up your emacs *init* file and checking yourself.

 This package parses your Emacs init file for `use-package` or `global-set-key` calls and summarises the bindings it detects on a package-by-package basis.

 When emacs is idle, a message is printed in the minibuffer utilising the same framework as [[https://github.com/AdrieanKhisbe/omni-quotes.el][`omni-quotes.el`]].

** Installation

   #+begin_src elisp
     (use-package remind-bindings
       :hook
       (after-init . remind-bindings-initialise)
       :custom
       (remind-bindings-initfile (expand-file-name "~/.emacs.d/init.el")))
   #+end_src

** Customization

 The default format in which shortcuts are displayed is:

 #+begin_src shell
 [packagename] key1 → func1 | key2 → func2 | key3 → func3
 #+end_src


 All text separators and decoration can be customised by modifying:

 #+begin_src elisp
   (setq remind-bindings--format-packbincom "[%s] %s")
   (setq remind-bindings--format-bincom "%s → %s")
   (setq remind-bindings--format-bindingsep " | ")
 #+end_src
