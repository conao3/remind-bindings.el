#+TITLE: remind-bindings.el

* Motivation and Description

It is sometimes hard to remember what bindings you have set without having to open up your emacs *init* file and checking yourself. 

This package parses your Emacs init file for `use-package` or `global-set-key` calls and summarises the bindings it detects on a package-by-package basis. 

When emacs is idle, a message is printed in the minibuffer utilising the same framework as [`omni-quotes.el`](https://github.com/AdrieanKhisbe/omni-quotes.el).

* Installation

  #+begin_src elisp
    (use-package remind-bindings
      :after-hook 'init
      :custom
      (remind-bindings-initfile (expand-file-name "~/.emacs.d/init.el")))
  #+end_src

* Customization

The default format in which shortcuts are displayed is:

#+begin_src shell
[packagename] key1 → func1 | key2 → func2 | key3 → func3
#+end_src


All text separators and decoration can be customised by modifying:

#+begin_src elisp
  (setq remind-bindings--format-packbincom "[%s] %s")
  (setq remind-bindings--format-bincom "%s → %s")
  (setq remind-bindings--format-bindingsep " | ")
#+end_src
